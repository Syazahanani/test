    <h3>Modern Jazz</h3>
    <p>At age 15, she performed as a soloist with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra.
        Although she was influenced by and played classical music from an early age, she turned to her father's
        records of female jazz musicians such as Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday to develop her musical style.
